# Saturday Shaders

These are GLSL shaders in the [ISF format](https://vidvox.github.io/isf/), configured to run in [VDMX](https://vidvox.net/) or any other application which supports ISF shader files. With minor adjustments they could be made to work in any application which supports GLSL shaders.

 
## Some examples of Saturday Shaders from the ISF sharing site
